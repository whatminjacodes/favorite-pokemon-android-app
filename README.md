# favorite-pokemon-android-app
A small project to showcase my current level of developing Android projects.

#### Project idea
I want to challenge myself to create a compact Android project to see how well and how fast I'm capable of doing it.

The app displays a list of 1st generation Pokemon and the user is able to favorite them.

#### What's included
- Android MVVM architecture
- Koin dependency injection
- Retrofit/OkHttp/Gson for fetching the Pokemon data from https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2
- Android Navigation component
- View binding and data binding
- Material Design best practices
- Light/Dark theme
