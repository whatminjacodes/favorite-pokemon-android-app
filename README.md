# favorite-pokemon-android-app
A small project to showcase my current level of developing Android projects.

### Project idea
I want to challenge myself to create a compact Android project to see how well and how fast I'm capable of doing it.

The app displays a list of 1st generation Pokemon and the user is able to favorite them.

### What's included
- Android MVVM architecture
- Koin dependency injection
- Retrofit/OkHttp/Gson for fetching the Pokemon data from https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2
- Android Navigation component
- View binding and data binding
- Material Design best practices
- Light/Dark theme

### Instructions
##### Android version
App is made to work with Android version 7 and later

##### Koin dependency injection
Koin version is 3.0.2. Find info about Koin from https://insert-koin.io/

### Setup times
Basic project skeleton using MVVM, View binding and Navigation component ~2h

Koin setup ~3h (I'm new with dependency injection)
